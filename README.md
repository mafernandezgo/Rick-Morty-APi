# üí´ React Archetype 01: SPA 

Aloha. This is a React archetype for small Single Page Apps (SPA) that get info from public APIs. This example get info from [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

This archetype uses:
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/)
- [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react)

Have tons of fun. With ü§ç, Pragma.

Help us improving people's lives by transforming businesses. [See more](https://www.pragma.com.co/proceso-de-contratacion).

## üåÄ Before any coding
First of all, the recommended version of Node must be installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/es/).

Once you verify the installed version, you are ready to have some fun. To verify node and npm versions open your terminal (CMD) and run:

### `node --version`
### `npm --version`
 
## üöÄ Let's get some fun
Now you are ready, in the project directory you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
